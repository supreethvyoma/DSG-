            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>
              Digital Sanskrit Guru is part of the initiative driven by <strong>Vyoma Linguistic Labs Foundation</strong>, 
              a multidisciplinary non-profit organization dedicated to preservation, learning, and promotion of Sanskrit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began in 2010 when our founders noticed the challenges many face while trying to master Sanskrit grammar 
              and scriptures. While the desire to learn was immense, the availability of specialized scholars was limited, especially for those 
              balancing learning with modern careers. The realization that <strong>technology is the bridge</strong> led to the birth of 
              our dedicated linguistic practice.
